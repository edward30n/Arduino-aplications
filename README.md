# Arduino-aplications
This reposatory have a bunch of code for different sensor as pulsometer, acelerometer, barometer, tempeture,infrared, and sending data to a sd. ultrasound  sensor.

Files:


     1)  Codigo: Here you will find 3 folders:
        a) pulsometro_con_SD:   here is the code for just the pulsometer with the sd.
        b) sensores:            here are all the basic codes to control each sensor.
        c) Sensores_unificados: here is the final code for the control of all the sensors integrated.
  
    2)  Documento: This folder has a detail explanation to all the proyect including the context for the device, the state of art, a conceptual framework, the components used, the conections, the restrictions, an analysis, results as well as all the flowcharts for each sensor, and the budget. Also, this folder has a picture of the final result of the mounting and a video (in a link) to show how it works. Everything is in spanish, you can translate it to your own mother language.


    3)  Resultados: this folder has two documents. The first one named "Datos.txt" has the row data extracted from the heart rate sensor. then, the excel has the infomation proceded in a graph.
